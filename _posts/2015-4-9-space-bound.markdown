About two weeks ago,when I finished reading the books,a desire for writing something emerged. Forgive me that I have to put it off until now.Reason?...probably I need some time to ponder the content or maybe the   procrastination...when it comes to the books,I am really grateful to my friend XiaoLan and his bookself.Fortunately,I have a chance to read the (The Grocery Store For Relieving Anxiety) after the (Waliking In The White Night).Maybe I should confess that  I'm not good at reading or composition.I am not brilliant enough to get the essence from two books.However, I think I am affected by the book,at least I got some feelings for me and for my life recently.


So it's all about feelings,from seamy side to sunny one.It's all about resentment,loneliness,pessimistism,jealousy,pressure, also about responsiblity,compliment,optimistism,treasuring and love.Everyday we live in the world surrounded by these feelings,we have to face with so many worries from them and have to make choices countlessly.I guess everyone wish that miraculous Grocery Store and that grandpa really exists, to relieve our worries and give us answer.Sometimes we really want to know what happens about ourselives in the future.But back to reality,when faced with choices,when we are confused with which way to go, are we really need someone to remind us? Maybe we have already got the answer in our mind ,what we need is only someone who can prove your choice is right, prove you are right.I'm not brilliant to be a reliever.Forgive my bluntness,the only suggestion I can give is that try your best to choose a sunny-smiling way when troubled with those worries and anxiety.Choosing a positive lifestyle,be optimitic for what will happen and  don't look back in anger.At least my life and my friends proves me right.


I have to talk about my friends here.The days are slipping past,we may have not so much time with each other. I want you to know how much I appreciate your help.I recognize true friends can affect me to make the right choice.It's so ridiculous that I thought I was not fear of loneliness.The fact about friends is that the more those men need you, the more you need them,like hermit crab.By the way,It's unbelieveable that a girl can affect me so deeply,changes what I used to considering, changes what I used to doing.Maybe I'm not really worthy of her.But it's enough and I'm content with the current situation.Look at the sun,just look how it shine.Thanks for her sunshine and apology for the trouble I caused. 


Grateful to my friends and those who worry me.I enjoy my life these days.Thanks to Mr.BigMing and Mr.Dragon, I persist in bodybuilding for a month.Though I feel pain everytime I get out GYM,it's worth. And I can't omit Mr.Black&Cu,Wstunes,Mr.Party,Mr.Nan...forgive me...so much,thanks so much,may you get amazing offers,you deserve more.


The days are sliping past that I wann the good things being last.
